prompt: |
  I need a detailed literature review on the "Logic and Accuracy (L&A) Testing" of electronic voting systems in the United States. The core of the research is to evaluate and compare the policies and procedures for L&A testing implemented by different U.S. states to verify voting equipment prior to elections. The review should thoroughly explore the following aspects: 1) the objectives of L&A testing, such as detecting equipment malfunctions, misconfigurations, and preventing specific types of fraud; 2) differences in testing procedures across jurisdictions, particularly among U.S. states, including the scope, rigor, and transparency of the tests; and 3) specific methodologies for evaluating L&A testing effectiveness, such as whether all devices and ballot styles are tested, whether the testing process is public, whether it can detect ballot option shifts, whether it verifies multi-ballot limits, and whether non-deterministic or randomized testing is utilized to enhance security.

  Restrictions are as follows:
  1. Cutoff Date: All cited literature must have been published on or before August 2022.
  2. Paper Language: Focus primarily on English-language literature.
  3. Publishing Institutions: Pay special attention to work published by institutions with outstanding research in election security, such as the University of Michigan.
  4. Conferences/Journals: Prioritize papers presented at top-tier security and electronic voting conferences, such as USENIX Security and USENIX EVT/E-Vote-ID.
