  I need a comprehensive literature review on the topic of causality in the application of machine learning algorithms for medical image analysis. My main focus is on how methods like causal inference and causal discovery can enhance the robustness, fairness, and explainability of models when addressing challenges such as domain shift, selection bias, and spurious correlations. Please emphasize the following aspects:
  1. Causal methods to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and domain adaptation problems.
  2. Techniques based on causal relationships to generate counterfactual medical images and their applications.
  3. Research utilizing causal analysis to improve algorithmic fairness, safety, and explainability.
  References should primarily be in English, especially papers published in top-tier conferences and journals such as MICCAI, ISBI, and IPMI. You may consider research outputs from institutions like Imperial College London. Importantly, your response must strictly reference papers published before November 2022.
